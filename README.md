# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place during the month of December, where participants solve a series of programming puzzles. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and participants are encouraged to find the solutions to these puzzles using their programming skills.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code provides a great opportunity to improve your coding skills, learn new algorithms, and have fun with fellow programmers. The puzzles are designed to be approachable yet challenging, making it suitable for coders of all skill levels.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by year and day. Each year has its own directory, and within each year's directory, there are separate directories for each day's puzzle. The structure looks like this:

```piss
└── 2021
    ├── day-01
    ├── day-02
    ├── ...
    └── day-25
```

For each day's puzzle, you will find the input file provided by Advent of Code, as well as my solution code. The solution code is implemented in [language], and the files are named accordingly.

## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions for a specific day, run "node [YEAR]/day-[NUMBER].js

I am working in parallel on a main file that runs all of them at once and gives all the answers as either a 2D map or just an array of both answers in a single string 

Please note that these solutions are my personal implementations, and there might be multiple ways to solve each puzzle. If you have any suggestions or alternative solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have a more optimized solution, found a bug, or want to add a solution in a different programming language, please feel free to contribute. Simply fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. I will review the contributions and merge them if they meet the guidelines.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are intended to be used as a reference or starting point to understand different problem-solving approaches. I encourage you to try solving the puzzles on your own before referring to the solutions. Remember, the real value lies in the learning experience gained from solving the problems.
